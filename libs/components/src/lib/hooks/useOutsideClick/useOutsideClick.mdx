- [Examples](#examples)

### How it works

A react hook to check whether the user has clicked outside a certain element. The element can be defined by setting a ref with the `useRef` hook and passing this in as the second argument. The first argument is a handler that can be defined whenever an outside click is detected.

````jsx
useOutsideClick(handler, ref, isActiveBoolean)
````
